| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Software                  | Authored application/tooling, scripts, tests, configuration, schemas and executable code examples, except the exclusions below.                                                                                          | GPL-3.0-or-later                                                     |
| Documentation             | Authored Markdown, policy/skill prose, narrative guidance and website documentation. Executable examples additionally use the software grant above. Third-party quotations and legal texts keep their original rights.   | CC-BY-SA-4.0                                                         |
| Font software             | 02_Typography/Space Grotesk/ contains original Space Grotesk fonts and notices. Do not replace the original notice or reserved-name conditions.                                                                          | OFL-1.1 under the accompanying OFL.txt                               |
| Official identity         | 01_Logos/, assets/contained-mark-*.png, assets/palette.json and assets/palette.svg, plus embedded or copied official logos, editable artwork and identity exports. The software/documentation grant does not cover them. | [VINASIG Brand Usage Policy](BRAND_POLICY.md)                        |
| Dependencies and notices  | Vendored libraries, upstream fonts/icons, installed packages and literal license texts retain their original notices. Existing permissive grants are not replaced.                                                       | Their respective original licenses                                   |
| Shared standards snapshot | Managed .vinasig/standards/ and .agents/skills/ files retain the agent-standards grants rather than inheriting this repository's primary grant.                                                                          | See [.vinasig/standards/LICENSES.md](.vinasig/standards/LICENSES.md) |

## Static website software

The new `site/` interface and `scripts/build-site.ts` use AGPL-3.0-or-later, either version 3 of the License or, at your option, any later version. The shared styles and preference runtime retain that upstream grant. This separate scope does not replace the archive tooling's existing GPL grant or the independent brand and font rights. The full text is in [LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-or-later.txt](LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-or-later.txt).

The public website links to the exact deployed source revision. Its distribution includes the software license texts, source notice, brand policy, documentation notice, original font notice and Lucide notice. See [site/NOTICE.txt](site/NOTICE.txt) and [the website publication decision](docs/website.md). Browser code and CSS have no runtime package dependency. `site/sources.json` pins the reviewed shared source. Sun and Moon icon paths come from Lucide 1.50.0 and retain [their upstream notice](LICENSES/Lucide.txt).

## Documentation reuse

VINASIG-authored documentation is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](LICENSES/CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt). Credit VINASIG and the respective credited authors, link the source and license, indicate changes, and share adaptations under the applicable share-alike terms. Do not imply endorsement. Embedded artwork and external source material are separately scoped.

## Independent inputs and output

Using this software does not by itself relicense user inputs, measurements, QR payloads, converted archives or generated images. Output is covered by the software license only when its content constitutes a covered work. Copied templates, underlying source content and retained third-party material keep their applicable rights.

## Contributions

New contributions should use the relevant license scope above unless a different compatible grant is explicitly identified and accepted. Retain authorship and upstream notices. Contributors must have permission to submit their material. No blanket copyright assignment is required. The current owner authorization does not fabricate consent from an external rights holder.

## Decision record

The software consists of local asset/integrity checks, with no network service. GPL fits the tools. Documentation is CC BY-SA, upstream Space Grotesk remains OFL, and official artwork is governed only by the separate brand policy.

See [the dated review](docs/audits/licensing-2026-10-04.md) for inspected ownership/dependencies, changes and any remaining human review. Earlier publication audits describe their historical state and are not the current license grant.
